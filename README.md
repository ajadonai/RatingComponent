## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [bootstrap5] (https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Jquery](https://jquery.com/) - JQuery library

### What I learned

I learnt alot while trying to create this component but here are the ones I feel should be mentioned:

- How to disable a button till user has interacted with other parts of the page
- How to center contents inside or outside a div (believe me or not, this always drives me crazy)

### Useful resources

- [button.disabled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSEhNb69XpI) - This helped me for Xwhen i was trying to figure out a way to disable my button
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
